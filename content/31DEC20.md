# Oh yea,  I am in quarantine

Yes, I am also on winter break from teaching, but, I am also under quarantine, so leaving the house isn't really an option.  This does give me plenty of time to work on these classes, and process what I have learned.  One thing that I am realizing is that I am rusty on the python that I began learning several months ago.  Skills are like tools, if you don't use them, keep them sharp, they begin to deteriorate.  So, in addition to linear algebra, I am starting back on to the python track.  First class isn't really a Python class, more of a background class in Data science, called Data Science Methodologies.  It should be fairly easy, but does give context to the processes involved in solving problems through data science.  Like how to decide what type of data is required, how to get the data, clean it, etc.
